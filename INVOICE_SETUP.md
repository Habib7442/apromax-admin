3. **Create a new Collection named "invoices"**
4. **Add the following attributes exactly as shown:**

|----------------|------|--------------|----------|---------|
| `invoiceNumber` | String | 255 | ‚úÖ | - |
| `invoiceDate` | Datetime | - | ‚úÖ | - |
| `dueDate` | Datetime | - | ‚úÖ | - |
| `contactName` | String | 255 | ‚úÖ | - |
| `contactNumber` | String | 50 | ‚úÖ | - |
| `clientName` | String | 255 | ‚úÖ | - |
| `clientAddress` | String | 1000 | ‚úÖ | - |

**Important Notes:**

- For Enum type (status), add these exact values: `draft`, `sent`, `paid`, `overdue`
- The `itemsJson` and `bankDetailsJson` fields store complex data as JSON strings
- Appwrite automatically adds `$id`, `$createdAt`, and `$updatedAt` fields

### 2. Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with the new collection ID:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_INVOICES_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_ACTUAL_COLLECTION_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_COLLECTION_ID` with the actual collection ID from Appwrite.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-select
```
